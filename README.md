Yongdong Huang, Yuanzhan Li, Xulong Cao and Siyu Zhang, Shen Caiâˆ— , Ting Lu,Yuqi Liu.An Efficient End-to-End 3D Model Reconstruction
based on Neural Architecture Search.

##Methodology
we complete the end-to-end network by classifying binary voxels.
Compared to other signed distance field (SDF) prediction or
binary classification networks, our method achieves significantly
higher reconstruction accuracy using fewer network parameters.

##Results

##Dataset
We use [Shapenet](https://shapenet.org/download/shapenetcore) and [Thingi10k](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/) datasets, both of which are available from their official website. [Thingi32]( https://github.com/nv-tlabs/nglod/issues/4) is composed of 32 simple shapes in Thingi10K. [ShapeNet150]( https://github.com/nv-tlabs/nglod/issues/4) contains 150 shapes in the ShapeNet dataset.
